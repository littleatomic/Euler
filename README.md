This is a collection of my solutions to problems posed on project Euler (http://projecteuler.net/).  All solutions
were done in C and all adhere to the 1 minute rule (all solutions run in under 1 minute on my desktop machine).

In keeping with the spirit of Project Euler, all solutions have been encrypted.
If you would like gain access to any of the solutions, please feel free to contact me at: vosrobbie@gmail.com

About Project Euler:
Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net ) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems 
that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at 
elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
